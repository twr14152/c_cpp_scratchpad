# C++ Scratchpad

This will be a wasteland for C++ sample code as I go through reading material.

Compiler notes
```
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ g++ CPPversion.cpp -o cpp_version_test
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ ./cpp_version_test

pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ g++ -std=c++17 CPPversion.cpp -o cpp_version_test
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ ./cpp_version_test 
C++17
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ g++ -std=c++2a CPPversion.cpp -o cpp_version_test
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ ./cpp_version_test

Study material:

Thoughts on reading material
- PPPC++ - Good book so far. 

- A Tour of C++ 2nd Edition - Assumes reader already familiar. Not really ready for this book.

- Sam Teach yourself C++ - pretty easy read, was bouncing between this and PPPC++ will bounce back to it now.
