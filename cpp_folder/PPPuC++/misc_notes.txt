Misc notes

switch vs if/else
- The switch logic will only work with values such as int, char, and enumerations. Not Strings...
- case statement must end with break.
- Must use if/else logic to compare strings values or maps.

constexpr vs const:


const should be used with an expression when the value of n is not known at compile time.

void testfunc(int n) 
{
  const int x = n + 7;
  cout << x << endl;
}
 
 
constexpr should be used with an expression if the value of n is known at compile time.
 
#define int MAX = 300;
 
void testfunc(int n)
{
    constexpr int b = max + 7
    cout << b << endl;
}
