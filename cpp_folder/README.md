# C++ Scratchpad

This will be a wasteland for C++ sample code as I go through reading material.

Compiler notes
```
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ g++ CPPversion.cpp -o cpp_version_test
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ ./cpp_version_test

pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ g++ -std=c++17 CPPversion.cpp -o cpp_version_test
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ ./cpp_version_test 
C++17
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/CPP_folder $ g++ -std=c++2a CPPversion.cpp -o cpp_version_test

Study material:

- C++ Programming in In Easy Steps 5th Edition

Website

Thoughts on reading material
- PPPC++ - Its a good book. Its very thorough, unfortunately its slow to develop when you dont read real fast.
- A Tour of C++ 2nd Edition - Assumes reader already familiar. Not really ready for this book.
- Sam Teach yourself C++ - pretty good sounding board for PPPC++.
- C++ Easy steps was a quick way to get back into this after some time off. Rather surface level coverage but enough to glean concepts.
