# C++ Scratchpad

This will be a wasteland for C++ sample code as I go through reading material.

Compiler notes

Thoughts on reading material
- Think C++ by Allen Downey - This guys my favorite technical author. His writing style is short chapters with clean and clear examples. The book very easy to read. I covers the basics. You will need more but this is an easy and recommended starting point.
- C++ Primer 5th Edition easier reading that PPPuC++.
- PPPuC++ - Its a good book, however its really thorough and very wordy. Per-Chapter breaks required to recharge. 
- A Tour of C++ 2nd Edition - This is a dense book and a slow read. No training wheels provided. My plan is to simply code out the examples and see what happens.
- Sam Teach yourself C++ - pretty good sounding board for PPPuC++.
- C++ in easy steps - was a quick way to get back into this after some time off. Rather surface level coverage but enough to glean concepts.
- Programming Abstractions in C++ has been the easiest read so far....(bare in mind I'm 10% the way through a 900+ Page book.

This is definitely going to be a marathon vs a sprint. Just dont have the brain capacity to quickly digest any of this material. Slow and steady.
