The C Programing Language Second Edition 
- Initial thoughts on the book
  - Going through the excercises in the book and the compiler is barking at me about the implicit 'int' return value. 
     pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/C_folder $ gcc -o ch1ex4 ch1ex4.c 
     ch1ex4.c:3:1: warning: return type defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
     main()
     ^~~~
pi@RaspPi4:~/Coding/C_folder $ ./ch1ex4 
  - Thats kinda driving me crazy
