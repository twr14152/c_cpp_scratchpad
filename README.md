This is a repository I'm using to learn C. 
A wasteland of code used only to aid in understanding how certain features work.

Books used.
- The C Programming Language 2e - TCPL
- Learn to code with C
- C Programming in easy steps 5e  
- Effective C 
- How to think like a computer scientist - C Version (Think C)
- Modern C
- Modern C for Absolute Beginners
- C Programming absolute beginners guide 3rd edt.

Comments about books.
- Learn to Code with C by Simon Long - Best book to start with. Very easy quick read. Does not cover everything but enough to get you started. The book is about 90 pages.

- C Programming in easy steps 5e - Its kind of a paint by number coding book. It does provide enough context to teach you the concepts. I worked through just about all of the examples in the book. I feel like I have a good grasp and could piece together some simple programs now. I do feel the what and how was covered more than the why. So like any book it served its purpose now on to the next. This is a good book to start with. Took about 2 weeks to work through coding out all the examples. There's a lot there to digest, more than the words on the page. You learn a lot by tweaking the examples to see what happens. (2nd)

- Think C - This book is my ideal type of book. Easy one to two day read. Reinforced concepts learned from other books with out extraneous exceptions. Its a good second book. More of an easy read less coding involved, but do recommend testing out some some of the examples. Approx 130 pages. 

- TCPL - is a good/great reference book if you are infront of the computer when reading it.
The concepts can get lost in the pages if your not coding it out to see for yourself. Makes it a slow read, at least for me.
I prefer a middle ground between reading and coding. Plan on finishing this book this month. will update review upon completion.

- Effective C - I'm 3 chapters in so far and im losing interest. The writing style is not as direct or easy as the other books I've read. The added focus on security just makes the reading more challenging and dry. Will pause and revisit at a later date.

- Modern C - impulse buy as an ad popped up in my screen. This book is available for free. The author released draft under creative commons license. Respect that so i dont feel too bad buying the book. Going switch gears for a bit and come back at a later date.

- Modern C for Absolute Beginners by Slobodan Dmitrovic- A really good book to get back into C after sometime away. The chapters are really easy to digest with complete code samples. The book is about ideal for my schedule and the time I have to allocate to this.

- C Programming Abs beg guide 3rd edt. - This is a really good book. 


My process is this.
Read test, read test..etc..etc..


Doing the same for C++ in this repo. I created a folder cpp_folder that has my notes and sample code in it
