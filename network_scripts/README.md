I wanted to try and recreate some of the automation scripts I've done in other languages in C. The first of those is ssh_client.c.  At the time of of this writting the script can log into a Cisco DevNet switch and issue multiple show and configuration commands. I will try and grow the functionality as time permits. This will be an iterative process, as I'm learning by doing.
