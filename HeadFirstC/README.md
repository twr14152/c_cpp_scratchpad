#Head First C

I saw some positive reviews of this book and thought I would check it out. So far its an easy read considering some of the topics. The style is meant to reinforce the learning. I would say that it has. Some people may not like it. I am not one of those people.

There have been some issues with some of the code but using the errate while reading has brought clarity to those issues.

I will post more the further along I get.
