This is a repository I'm using to learn C. 
A wasteland of code used only to aid in understanding how certain features work.

Books used.
- The C Programming Language 2e - tcpl
- Introduction to C & GUI
- C Programming in easy steps 5e  
- Effective C - 

Comments about books. 
TCPL - is a good/great reference book if you are infront of the computer when reading it.
The concepts can get lost in the pages if your not coding it out to see for your self. Makes it a slow read for me.
I prefer a middle ground between reading and coding.

C Programming in easy steps 5e - Its kind of a paint by number coding book. It does provide enough context to teach you the concepts. I worked through just about all examples. I feel like I have a good grasp and could piece together some simple programs now. I do feel the what and how was covered more than the why. So like any book it served its purpose now on to the next.

read test read test read test ....etc


Doing the same for C++ in this repo. I created a folder cpp_folder that has my notes and sample code in it
