const should be used with an expression when the value of n is not known at compile time.

void testfunc(int n) 
{
  const int x = n + 7;
  cout << x << endl;
}
 
 
constexpr should be used with an expression if the value of n is known at compile time.
 
 #define int MAX = 300;
 
void testfunc(int n)
{
    constexpr int b = max + 7
    cout << b << endl;
}
